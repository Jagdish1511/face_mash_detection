# face_mash_detection
Face mask detection using Keras and OpenCv
During pandemic COVID-19, WHO has made wearing masks compulsory to protect against this deadly virus. In this project we will develop a machine learning project â€“ Real-time Face Mask Detector with Python.
We will build a real-time system to detect whether the person on the webcam is wearing a mask or not. We will train the face mask detector model using Keras and OpenCV.
After detecting the face from the webcam stream, we are going to save the frames containing the face. Later we will pass these frames (images) to the mask detector classifier to find out if a person is wearing mask or not
